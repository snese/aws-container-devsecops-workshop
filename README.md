## Integrating security into your container pipeline

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to leverage AWS development tools and open-source projects to integrate automated security testing into a CI/CD pipeline to build and release hardened container images.  You will learn about common security concerns within containers and discuss a variety of patterns for creating security-centric release control into an AWS CodePipeline.  Additionally, you'll learn how to add feedback loops to ensure your developers are quickly able to respond to security issues within their container-based applications.
